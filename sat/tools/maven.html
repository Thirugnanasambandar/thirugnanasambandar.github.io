        <h1>Maven</h1>
        Maven or Apache Maven is an open source tool to build and maintain the
        projects. It's primarily used for Java projects but it can also be used
        for projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala and many other languages.
        <h3>Build:</h3>
        <p>
            Maven is a build-automation tool which will help us to handle the
            build lifecycles by handling the dependencies. Below are the default
            lifecycle of Maven:
            <ul>
                <li>Validate</li>
                <li>Compile</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Package</li>
                <li>Install</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Dependency Management:</h3>
        <p>
            A predominant feature in Maven is dependency management. Maven has a
            central repository for all commonly used libraries and plugins. All
            the dependent tools and plugins of the project are tracked in POM
            file with reference to central maven repository. When project is
            build for first time, all the dependencies will be downloaded from
            central repository and added to local repository.
            If there is any transit dependencies, then they are automatically
            handled by Maven which gives big relief to the developers.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing Project Structure:</h3>
        <p>
            Maven by default creates the folder hierarchy for managing the
            project files. This helps to manage/maintain the project files
            efficiently.
