    <h1>ELK Stack</h1>
    <p>
        ELK is the acronym for Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.

    <div>
        
        <h3>Elasticsearch</h3>
        <p>
            Elasticsearch/Elastic stack is a distributed, open source, search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, structured and unstructured. It's a RESTful application. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucne and it's famous for speed and scalability.
            It is basically a document store like MongoDB. Data is stored as "Schema-less"  JSON objects (like No SQL documents). It provides near real-time search (meaning there is only a small latency from a document is indexed untill it is searchable).
            
            <div>
                <br> <i> Communication to server is done through HTTP REST API. </i>
                <span class="codeblockheader"><span class="title">Title: Unrefactored Code</span><span class="lang">Language: Shell</span></span>
                <code class="codeblock">
                    curl =X {REST Verb (GET/POST)} {Node}:{Port}/{Index}/{Type}/{ID}
                </code>
            </div>
            <h4 class="inline-block">Speed:</h4> Elasticsearch uses inverted indices for full text querying, BKD trees for storing numeric and geo data, and a column store for analytics.<br>
            <h4 class="inline-block">Scalability:</h4> Run it on your laptop or huundreds of server with petabytes of data. Single node runs the same way as your in a 300-node cluster.<br>
            <h4 class="inline-block">Relevance</h4> Can handle complex typos and ranks the search results based on variety of factors from frequencty or recency to popularity and beyond.<br>
            <h4 class="inline-block">Resiliency</h4> Detects failures to keep your cluster safe and available. Operates on a distributed environment.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Kibana:</h3>
        <p>
            Its an analytics and visualization platform. Kibana can be treated as elastic search dashboard, providing line chart, pie chart and many others. Multiple dashboards can be created for different dashboards. It can be also used to search the elasticsearch logs.
        </p>
        
        
            
        <div style="display: flex;">
        <span>
            <h3>Logstash:</h3> 
            <p>
                Its a data processing pipeline use to send the information to elasticsearch. Logstash has evolved to support multiple applications other than elasticsearh in recent times. Data logstash receives are treated as events and these events can be sent multiple destinations like elasticsearch, email, kafka. Logstash has 3  parts. 1. Inputs, 2. Filters and 3. output olugins.

        Elasticsearch is the heart of elastic stack but elastic stack so most of the time Elastic stack is refereed as Elasticsearch. Elastic stack includes other tools which is optionally used with elasticsearch. Below are those components of elastic stack:

        <div class="liblock">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>X-Pack:</h4> Provides authentication and authorization for Kibana and Elastic search. Supports LDAP and roll based configuration. It also providesalerting. Reports can be generated automatically or manually. X-Pack also provides Machine learning feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Graph:</h4> Identify relevance between the data. Integrated into applications using API and also can be visualized using Kibana.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>SQL:</h4> Elasticsearch queries are written using Query DSL(proprietery Query language). But DSL is very verbose. So Elasticsearch SQL provides an API to write SQL query and it internally converts into Query DSL.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Beats:</h4> Beats are data shippers. They basically contain bunch of light weight tools which can be installed in your application to send data to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>FileBeat:</b> Used to collect log files from Apache webserver or MySQL or Kibana or Postgres and send it to Elasticsearch.</li>
                        <li><b>MtricBeat:</b> Collects system and service information E.g. CPU and Memory usages</li>
                        <li><b>PacketBeat:</b> Colelcts network data E.g. Http Requests</li>
