        <h1>Improve Email Communication</h1>
        <h2>Address 3 - Ws(Who, What and When) while assigning the task:</h2>
        <p>When you assign work to anyone through email, then these 3 W's are
            mandatory to avoid any potential miscommunication. Let us look at
            each of these Ws in detail:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Who:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is basically the name of the person who you
                            want to complete the task.</li>
                        <li>When you are assigning tasks in an email, you should
                            start the ask by using the name of a single
                            person(not using group)</li>
                        <li>If you assign the task using "All" or "Team", you
                            will trigger <b>Bystander Effect,</b> where everyone
                            will assume someone else will pick the task and no
                            one ever does.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Incase of trainings which you want whole team to undergo,
                        its okay to address to whole team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>What:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the description of the exact task you
                                need someone to do.</li>
                            <li>Don't be ambiguous and avoid making any
                                assumptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>When:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This refers to the exact date and time whent
                                he/she taks needs to be completed by.</li>
                            <li>One should always give a deadline, even if it's
                                a fake because it gives your recepient both a
                                clear goal and incentive to get the task done.</li>
                            <li>Include timezone when you have people working
                                across timezones.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

                                    <h4>Action oriented emails:</h4>
                                    Include the 3Ws in abbreviated way in
                                    subject line if the email includes actions
                                    you need someone to do. Also its a good
                                    habbit to include <b>[ACTION]</b> prefix in
                                    the subject line to stress the importance.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Example:</b><i>[ACTION] Micheal - need
                                        the audit report by tomorrow EOD</i>
                                </p>

                                    <h4>Not an action oriented emails:</h4>
                                    Add prefix modifiers such as URGENT,
                                    CONFIDENTIAL, IMP or FYI in the subject to
                                    explain what the email is about. If
                                    modifiers are added as suffix then it might
                                    get truncated in mobile apps due to window
                                    size.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    <h4>Write entire email if its short message:</h4>
                                    If your message is extremely short, then use
                                    the subject line itself as the entire email,
                                    just like you would in a text message.
                                    Suffix the message with <b>&lt;EOM&gt;</b>,
                                    which stands for "End Of Message".
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Example:</b><i>Quick question: Are you

                                    <h4>Change the subject line only when
                                        needed:</h4>
                                    While replying to email, avoid modifying the
                                    subject line unless you absolutely have to.
                                    Because most email applications, identify
                                    emails based on the subject line text, and
                                    group them usnig it. so changing the subject
                                    line will mess the grouping feature up.

                                Most people don't know what they want when they
                                send an email. This is partly due to a form of
                                cognitive bias call <b>Curse of knowledge</b>,
                                where things might be clear in your own head but
                                not translated in right way in text.
                                Reason for sending the email should be 100%
                                clear and you should ask yourself, <i>"What do I
                                    really want the recipient to do or to know?"
                                    as a first step before writing a single

                                the begining of the email. Don't pad your
                                message with useless verbiage. Start with the
                                most important information first.

        <h2>Breaking longer emails into 2 parts (1. Quick Summary and 2.
            Details):</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Quick Summary:</h3>
            This section should be five sentences or less. It should summarize
            the mail points of your long email. State all actions so that they
            are not burried in the long email. Think of this quick summary
            section as an <b>executive summary of a long report</b> - at a
            glance, the paragraph gives people the gist of your message if they
            dont have time to read the whole thing.
            <h3>Details:</h3>
            Label the section with subheadings like <b>"Details"</b>, <b>"Background"</b>,
            or <b>"Supporting Information"</b>. This is where tou write out all
            the additional information that supports your summary. Don't shy

                When action is given to a person working across different time
                zone
                then it creates confusion. So its better to spell out the
                timezone
                to avoid confusion.
            </p>
            <h3>Spell out acronyms:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spell out acronyms at-least once in a message when you are
                    not sure whether everyone in the group knows the acronym.</li>
                <li>Best practice is to spell the acronym in the first

                    there is absolutely no confusion for the readers</li>
                <li>They hold people accountable for getting back to you by a

            <p>Dont end an email with phrases like <b>"Thoughts?"</b> or <b>"What

                    like
                    A, B, or C?</b>. This guides them give specific answers
                rather
                than inviting never-ending opinions.
            </p>
            <h3>Don't ask "When do you think we should meet?":</h3>

                <li>When you ask for such input from 10 member thread in
                    different timezones then you would get avalanche of
                    responses</li>
                <li>A better way to state something like "Can we meet on Monday
                    for 30mins after 2 weeks?"</li>
